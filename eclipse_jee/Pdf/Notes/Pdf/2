         jasperreports-{version}.jar

         commons-beanutils-{version}.jar

         commons-collections-{version}.jar

         commons-digester-{version}.jar

         commons-logging-{version}.jar

These are the minimum requirements for creating a report. You might have to add more JAR files for using other features of JasperReports. For example, to create a chart you have to add jfreechart-{version}.jar file. All these jar files are already included in the lib/dist directory of JasperReports, so you do not have to download these.
 
Download jasperreports-1.3.0-project. zip or any other version of 
JasperReports from http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net. Then unzip it where you want.
